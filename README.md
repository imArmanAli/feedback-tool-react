# Feedback Tool

The Feedback Tool is a web application developed using React for the frontend and Laravel 8 for the backend. It allows users to see and provide feedbacks on various topics.

## Running the Application

Before running the application, ensure that the Laravel server is up and running. Please refer to the Laravel README file for instructions on setting up and running the backend server.

### Setting Up the Frontend

1. **Clone the Repository**: Open an empty folder and initialize a Git repository by typing the following commands in the command prompt:

    ```
    git init
    ```

    Then, clone the repository by executing:

    ```
    git clone [repository_url]
    ```

    Replace `[repository_url]` with the URL of the repository.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Once the repository is cloned, navigate into the project directory and install the dependencies by running the following command:

    ```
    npm i --force
    ```

    This command will install all the necessary dependencies for the frontend application.

3. **Start the Application**: After the dependencies are installed, start the application by executing:

    ```
    npm start
    ```

    This command will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.
